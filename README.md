## SerializedListPropertyEditor for XAF ##

[DevExpress XAF](http://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/Application_Framework/) supports many standard editors and provides the ability to extend these for custom requirements.

The goal of this project is to provide a custom web editor which serializes a list of related objects into a string.
